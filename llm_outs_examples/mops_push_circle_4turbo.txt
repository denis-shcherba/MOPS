```python
def gen_plan(state: PushState, circle_center: list, circle_radius: float, push_offsets: list):
    
    import numpy as np

    # Build the circle with the blocks
    actions = []
    num_blocks = len(state.frames) - 1  # Assuming the first frame is not a block
    angle_step = 2 * np.pi / num_blocks

    for i, block in enumerate(state.frames):
        if "block" in block.name:
            # Calculate target position on the circle
            angle = i * angle_step
            target_x = circle_center[0] + circle_radius * np.cos(angle)
            target_y = circle_center[1] + circle_radius * np.sin(angle)

            # Calculate push start and end points
            start_x = block.x_pos + push_offsets[i][0]
            start_y = block.y_pos + push_offsets[i][1]
            end_x = target_x + push_offsets[i][2]
            end_y = target_y + push_offsets[i][3]

            # Add push action
            actions.append(Action("push_motion", [start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y]))

    return actions

def gen_initial_guess(initial: PushState):
    num_blocks = len(initial.frames) - 1  # Assuming the first frame is not a block
    return {
        "circle_center": [0.0, 0.0],  # BBO initial value for the center of the circle
        "circle_radius": 0.2,  # BBO initial value for the radius of the circle
        "push_offsets": [[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0] for _ in range(num_blocks)],  # BBO initial values for push offsets
    }
```

This plan and initial guess setup assumes that the blocks are named with "block" in their names and that the first frame in the list is not a block. Adjustments may be needed based on the actual frame setup and naming conventions.
